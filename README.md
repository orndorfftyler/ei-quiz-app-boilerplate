### Florida Facts Quiz App project

[Test your knowledge of the Sunshine State!](https://orndorfftyler.github.io/quiz-app/)

This is a simple 5 question quiz that keeps track of the user's current question and score.

This exercise helped me get familiar with jQuery and get used to breaking up a program into many smaller specialized functions.

I also used wireframing for the first time in this project. Before writing the JS allowing the user to navigate the quiz, I wrote some basic HMTL/CSS describing each different screen that would be needed. This basic wireframe is in a separate repo called quiz-app-wireframe.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
